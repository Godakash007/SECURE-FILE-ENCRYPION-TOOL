Secure File Encryption Tool  

This project is a Python-based encryption tool that provides secure AES-256 encryption and decryption for files. It features a password strength checker, secure key storage using RSA, and a file deletion mechanism after multiple failed decryption attempts. The tool is built with a user-friendly GUI using Tkinter and CustomTkinter.  

Features  
- AES Encryption & Decryption to protect files securely  
- Password Strength Checker to ensure strong password selection  
- Secure Key Storage using RSA encryption for private key security  
- Auto File Deletion after three incorrect password attempts  
- Graphical User Interface for simple and interactive file encryption and decryption  

Technologies Used  
- Python with Tkinter and CustomTkinter  
- AES Encryption using PyCryptodome  
- RSA for key storage and security  
- File handling with security mechanisms  

How to Use  
1. Select a file using the browse option  
2. Enter a secure password, and the tool will display its strength  
3. Click "Encrypt" to secure the file  
4. To decrypt, select the encrypted file, enter the correct password, and click "Decrypt"  

This tool helps secure confidential files and protect sensitive data efficiently. Let me know if you need modifications.
